It removes unnecessary information and changes the price details to simple numbers by getting rid of symbols and words. The program also checks details like the number of rooms and parking spaces, making sure they are in the right place and shown as numbers. It also looks for houses that come with or without furniture, marking them correctly. At the end, it changes the property type (like \"House\" or \"Apartment\") into a format that a computer can easily understand. If any type is missing, the program adds it. Now, the cleaned-up data is ready for more use, like studying or making predictions."
